# React + Vite Project

## Overview

This template provides a minimal setup for developing React applications using Vite. It features Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a smooth development experience and integrates ESLint for code quality. You can choose between two official plugins for React: Babel and SWC.

## Features

- **Fast Development**: Leverage Vite's fast build and serve capabilities.
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Enjoy instant updates in your application as you make changes.
- **ESLint Integration**: Maintain code quality with built-in ESLint rules.
- **Flexible Plugin Options**: Choose between Babel or SWC for Fast Refresh.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn.

### Development

To start the development server, run the appropriate command for npm or yarn.

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified).

### Production Build

To create a production build of your application, run the appropriate command for npm or yarn.

This command will generate a `dist` directory containing your optimized application. You can serve this directory with any static file server.

### Previewing the Production Build

To preview your production build locally, run the appropriate command for npm or yarn.

You can then navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see how your application performs in production.

## Choosing a React Plugin

This template supports two React plugins:

### 1. Using Babel

For projects that prefer Babel, ensure the appropriate configuration is included in your `vite.config.js`.

### 2. Using SWC

If you prefer using SWC for a faster build process, update your `vite.config.js` accordingly.

## ESLint Configuration

The project includes ESLint rules by default. You can customize these rules in the `.eslintrc.js` file. To run ESLint and check for issues, use the appropriate command for npm or yarn.
